# Replace new recommendations to spotify playlist

Look, I get bored of the same 50 songs somehow in the discover weekly playlist by Spotify...

So I made a thing

## New dailies

Using a new playlist, running this script should allow you to update your playlist with new songs given a limit of songs, replacing the old songs completely.

## Installation

Using Venv

```
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate //make sure you have permission to run scripts

pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running

Currently using newTestPlaylist.py, literally just run main() lmfao
